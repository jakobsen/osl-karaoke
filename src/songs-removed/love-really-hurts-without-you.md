You run around town like a fool and you think that it's groovy
You're givin' it to some other guy who gives you the eye
You don't give nothin' to me
You painted a smile and you dress all the while to excite me
But don't you know you're turning me on
I know that it's wrong, but I can't stop this pain inside me

Baby, love really hurts without you,
Love really hurts without you,
And it's breaking my heart,
But what can I do, baby,

Love really hurts without you,
Love really hurts through and through
And it's breaking my heart
But what can I do without you

You walk like a dream and you make like you're queen of the action
You're using ev'ry trick in the book the way that you look You're really something to see,
You cheat and you lie to impress any guy that you fancy,
But don't you know I'm out of my mind, so give me a sign
And help to ease the pain inside me.

Baby, love really hurts without you,
Love really hurts without you,
And it's breaking my heart,
But what can I do, baby,

Love really hurts without you,
Love really hurts through and through
And it's breaking my heart
But what can I do without you

Baby, love really hurts without you,
Love really hurts without you,
And it's breaking my heart,
But what can I do, baby,

Love really hurts without you,
Love really hurts through and through
And it's breaking my heart
But what can I do

Baby, love really hurts without you,
Love really hurts without you,
And it's breaking my heart,
But what can I do, baby,

Love really hurts without you,
Love really hurts through and through
And it's breaking my heart
so what can I do without you....
