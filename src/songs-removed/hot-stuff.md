Sittin' here eatin' my heart out waitin'
Waitin' for some lover to call
Dialed about a thousand numbers lately
Almost rang the phone off the wall

Lookin' for some hot stuff baby this evenin'
I need some hot stuff baby tonight
I want some hot stuff baby this evenin'
Gotta have some hot stuff
Gotta have some love tonight
I need hot stuff
I want some hot stuff
I need some hot stuff

Lookin' for a lover who needs another
Don't want another night on my own
Wanna share my love with a warm blooded lover
Wanna bring a wild man back home

Gotta have some hot love baby this evenin'
I need some hot stuff baby tonight
I want some hot stuff baby this evenin'
Gotta have some lovin'
Gotta have love tonight
I need hot stuff
Hot love
Lookin' for hot love

_solo_

How's about some hot stuff baby this evenin'
I need some hot stuff baby tonight
Lookin' for my hot stuff baby this evenin'
I need some hot stuff baby tonight, yeah-yeah
I want some hot stuff this evenin'
I want some hot stuff baby tonight
