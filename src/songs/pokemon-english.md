I wanna be the very best
Like no one ever was
To catch them is my real test
To train them is my cause

I will travel across the land
Searching far and wide
Teach Pokemon to understand
The power that's inside

Pokemon!
Gotta catch 'em all-- It's you and me
I know it's my destiny - Pokemon!
Ooooh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend - Pokemon!
Gotta catch 'em all-- Our hearts so true
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me and I'll teach you Pokemon!
Gotta catch 'em all!
Gotta catch 'em all! Yeeaa.

Every challenge along the way
With courage I can face
I will battle everyday
To claim my rightful place
Come with me the time is right
There's no better team
Arm in arm we'll win the fight
It's always been our dream

Pokemon! Gotta catch 'em all--
It's you and me
I know it's my destiny - Pokemon!
Ooooh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend - Pokemon!
Gotta catch 'em all-- Our hearts so true
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me and I'll teach you - Pokemon!
Gotta catch 'em all!
Gotta catch 'em all!

Gotta catch 'em all!

Gotta catch 'em all!
Gotta catch 'em all!

Pokemon! Gotta catch 'em all--
It's you and me
I know it's my destiny - Pokemon!
Ooooh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend - Pokemon!
Gotta catch 'em all-- Our hearts so true
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me and I'll teach you - Pokemon!
Gotta catch 'em all!
Gotta catch 'em all! - Pokemon!
