ah-ah-ah x3
Do you remember
the 21st night of September?
Love was changing the minds of pretender
While chasing the clouds away

Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing
As we danced in the night remember
How the stars stole the night away

Ah-ah-ah

Ba de ya – say do you remember
Ba de ya – dancing in September
Ba de ya – never was a cloudy day

ba-du-du-ba-du-du-ba-du-du-ba-du-du _x3_
(Oh-waaaaay)

My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love remember
How we knew love was here to stay

Now December
Found the love that we shared in September
Only blue talk and love remember
The true love we share today

Ah-ah-ah

Ba de ya – say do you remember
Ba de ya – dancing in September
Ba de ya – never was a cloudy day

Ba de ya – de ya yo _(forts..)_ – say do you remember
Ba de ya – dancing in September
Ba de ya – golden dreams were shiny days (De yeaaaah)

Love bells was ringing
Our souls were singing
Do you remember, never a cloudy day

And we said
Ba de ya – say do you remember
Ba de ya – dancing in September
Ba de ya – never was a cloudy day

And we said
Ba de ya – say do you remember
Ba de ya – dancing in September
Ba de ya – golden dreams were shiny days (de yaaaaah)

Ba de ya de ya de oh (acapella)
Ba de ya de ya de oh
Ba de ya de ya de oh (de yeeah)
Ba de ya de ya de oh
Ba de ya de ya de oh
Ba de ya de ya de oh (de yeeaaah)

And we said
Ba de ya – say do you remember
Ba de ya – dancing in September
Ba de ya – never was a cloudy day

And we said
Ba de ya – say do you remember
Ba de ya – dancing in September
Ba de ya – golden dreams were shiny days (de yaaaaah)
