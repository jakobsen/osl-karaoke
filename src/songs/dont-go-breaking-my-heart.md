Don't go breaking my heart
I couldn't if I tried
Honey if I get restless
Baby you're not that kind

Don't go breaking my heart
You take the weight off of me
Honey when you knock on my door
Ooh, I gave you my key
Woo hoo Nobody knows it 
When I was down
I was your clown 
Woo hoo Nobody knows it
(Nobody knows... it)
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
Oh-oh I give you my heart

So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
_(kort break)_
Don't go breaking my heart

Nobody told us
'Cause nobody showed us
Now it's up to us babe
Whoa I think we can make it
So don't misunderstand me
You put the light in my life
Oh, you put the spark to the flame
I got your heart in my sight
Woo hoo Nobody knows it
But when I was down I was your clown
Woo hoo Nobody knows it
(Nobody knows... it)
Right from the start I gave you my heart

Oh-oh I gave you my heart 
Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart

_(Solo)_

Woo hoo Nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
Oh-oh I give you my heart

Don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
(Don't go breaking my)
(Don't go breaking my)
Don't go breaking my heart

I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
(Don't go breaking my)
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
(Don't go breaking my)
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
(Don't go breaking my)
I won't go breaking your heart
