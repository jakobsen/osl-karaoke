I'm coming out
I'm coming out

I'm coming out
I want the world to know
Got to let it show

I'm coming out
I want the world to know
Got to let it show

There's a new me coming out
And I just have to live
And I want to give
I'm completely positive

I think this time around
I am gonna do it
Like you never knew it
Oh, I'll make it through

The time has come for me
To break out of the shell
I have to shout
That I am coming out

I'm coming out
I want the world to know
I got to let it show
I'm coming out
I want the world to know
I got to let it show

I'm coming out (coming)
I want the world to know (out)
Got to let it show (I'm coming)
I'm coming out (coming)
I want the world to know (out)
Got to let it show

I've got to show the world
All that I want to be
And all my abilities

There's so much more to me
Somehow, I'll have to make them
Just understand
I got it well in hand
And, oh, how I've planned
I'm spreadin' love
There is no need to fear
And I just feel so good
Every time I hear

I'm coming out
I want the world to know
I got to let it show

I'm coming out (coming)
I want the world to know (out)
Got to let it show (I'm coming)

I'm coming out (coming)
I want the world to know (out)
Got to let it show

I'm coming out
I want the world to know
Got to let it show

I'm coming out
I want the world to know
Got to let it show (want the world to know)
(I got to let it show)

I'm coming out
I want the world to know
Got to let it show

I'm coming out (I'm coming)
I want the world to know (out)
Got to let it show
(I want the world to know, gotta let it show)

I'm coming out (I'm, I'm, I'm)
I want the world to know (I'm coming out)
Got to let it show (watch out, I'm coming out)
