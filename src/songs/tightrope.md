Whoa Another day
I take your pain away

(oh) Some people talk about you
Like they know all about you
When you get down they doubt you
And when you tipping on the scene Yeah they talkin' about it
'Cause they can't tip all on the scene with you talk about it
T-T-T-Talkin' about it

When you get elevated,
They love it or they hate it
You dance up on them haters
Keep getting funky on the scene
While they jumpin' round you
They trying to take all your dreams
But you can't allow it

'Cause baby whether you're
high or low
Whether you're high or low
You gotta tip on the tightrope (Tip, tip on it)
T-T-T-Tip on the tightrope (Tip, tip on it)

Whether you're high or low (High or low)
Baby whether you're high or low (High or low)
You got to tip on the tightrope (Tip, tip on it)
Now let me see you do the tightrope (Tip, tip on it)

oo
I tip on alligators and little rattle snakers (oo)
But I'm another flavor
Something like a terminator (oo)
Ain't no equivocating
I fight for what I believe (ba, bapaba, bapapa, bah)
Why you talkin' about it
Sh-Sh-She's talkin' about it

Some calling me a sinner
Some calling me a winner (oo)
I'm calling you to dinner
And you know exactly what I mean, (oo)
Yeah I'm talking about you
You can rock or you can leave (ba, bapaba, bapaba, bah)
Watch me tip without you
