You're so hot, teasing me
So you're blue but I can't take a chance on a chick like you
That's something I couldn't do

There's that look in your eyes
I can read in your face that your feelings are driving you wild
Ah, but girl/boy you're only a child

Well I can dance with you honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you baby Flirt a little maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?

Take it easy (take it easy)
Better slow down girl
That's no way to go
Does your mother know?

Take it easy (take it easy)
Try to cool it girl
Take it nice and slow
Does your mother know?

I can see what you want
But you seem pretty young to be searching for that kind of fun
So maybe I'm not the one

Now you're so cute, I like your style
And I know what you mean when you give me a flash of that smile (smile)
But girl/Boy you're only a child

Well I can dance with you honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?

And I can chat with you baby
Flirt a little maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?

Take it easy (take it easy)
Better slow down girl/boy
That's no way to go
Does your mother know?

Take it easy (take it easy)
Try to cool it girl/boy
Take it nice and slow
Does your mother know?
