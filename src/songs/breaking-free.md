Breaking free
We're soarin', flyin'
There's not a star in heaven
That we can't reach
If we're trying
So we're breaking free

You know the world can see us
In a way that's different than who we are
Creating space between us
'Til we're separate hearts

But your faith it gives me strength
Strength to believe

We're breakin' free
We're soarin'
Flyin'
There's not a star in heaven
That we can't reach
If we're trying
Yeah, we're breaking free

**Troy:**
Oh, we're breakin' free

**Gabriella:**
Ohhhh

**Troy:**
Can you feel it building
Like a wave the ocean just can't control

**Gabriella:**
Connected by a feeling
Ohhh, in our very souls

**Troy:**
Very souls, ohhh

**Both:**
Rising 'til it lifts us up
So everyone can see us
We're breakin' free

**Gabriella:**
We're soarin'

**Troy:**
Flyin'

**Both:**
There's not a star in heaven
That we can't reach

**Troy:**
If we're trying
Yeah we're breaking free

**Gabriella:**
Ohhhh runnin'

**Troy:**
Climbin'
To get to that place

**Both:**
To be all that we can be

**Troy:**
Now's the time

**Both:**
So we're breaking free

**Troy:**
We're breaking free

**Garbeille:**
Ohhh, yeah


**Troy:**
More than hope
More than faith

**Gabriella:**
This is true
This is fate
And together
We see it comin'

**Troy:**
More than you
More than me
Not a want, but a need

**Both:**
Both of us breakin' free
Soarin'

**Troy:**
Flyin'

**Both:**
There's not a star in heaven
That we can't reach
If we're trying

**Troy:**
Yeah we're breaking free

**Gabriella:**
Breaking free

Were runnin'

**Troy:**
Ohhhh, climbin'

**Both:**
To get to the place
To be all that we can be
Now's the time

**Troy:**
Now's the time

**Gabriella:**
So we're breaking free

**Troy:**
Ohhh, we're breaking free

**Gabriella:**
Ohhhh

You know the world can see us
In a way that's different than who we are
