Hi, hi we're your weather girls
Ah-huh
And have we got news for you
You better listen
Get ready, all you lonely girl
And leave those umbrellas at home
Alright

Humidity is rising (uh rising), barometer's getting low (how low, girl) (uh,o)
According to all sources (what sources now), the street's the place to go

'Cause tonight for the first time (first time)
Just about half-past ten (half past ten)
For the first time in history
It's gonna start raining men (start raining men)
_Koristene:_ men men men

It's raining men, hallelujah, it's raining men, amen
I'm gonna go out I’m gonna let myself get
Absolutely soaking wet
It's raining men, hallelujah
It's raining men, every specimen
Tall, blonde, dark and lean
Rough and tough and strong and mean

God bless mother nature, she's a single woman too
She took off to heaven _(trill)_ and she did what she had to do
She (she taught every angel) taught every angel she rearranged the sky
So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy

It's raining men, hallelujah
It's raining men, amen
It's raining men, hallelujah
It's raining men, amen

I feel stormy weather moving in
about to begin (about to begin)
Hear the thunder don't you lose your head
Rip off the roof and stay in bed

God bless mother nature, she's a single woman too
She took off to heaven and she did what she had to do
She taught every angel, she rearranged the sky
So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy
Oh, It’s raining men, yeah

Humidity's rising (humidity's rising)
Barometer's getting low (it's getting low, low, low, low)

According to all sources (according to all sources)
The street's the place to go
'Cause tonight for the first time (first time)
Just about half past ten (half past ten)
For the first time in history
It's gonna start raining men (start raining men)

It's raining men, hallelujah, it's raining men, amen
It's raining men, hallelujah, it's raining men, amen
