I see you driving 'round town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Fuck you" (ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like, "Fuck you and fuck her, too"
Said, "If I was richer, I'd still be with ya"
Ha, now ain't that some shit?
(Ain't that some shit?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a "Fuck you" (ooh, ooh, ooh)

Yeah, I'm sorry
I can't afford a Ferrari
But that don't mean I can't get you there
I guess he's an Xbox and I'm more Atari
But the way you play your game ain't fair

I pity the fool that falls in love with you
(Oh shit, she's a gold digger)
Well (just thought you should know, nigga)
Ooh, I've got some news for you
Yeah, go run and tell your little boyfriend

I see you driving 'round town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Fuck you" (ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like, "Fuck you and fuck her, too"
Said, "If I was richer, I'd still be with ya"
Ha, now ain't that some shit?
(Ain't that some shit?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a "Fuck you" (ooh, ooh, ooh)

Now I know that I had to borrow
Beg and steal and lie and cheat
Tryna keep ya, tryna please ya
'Cause being in love with your ass ain't cheap

Now I pity the fool
That falls in love with you
(Oh shit, she's a golddigger)
Well (just thought you should know, nigga)
Ooh, I've got some news for you
I really hate your ass right now

I see you driving 'round town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Fuck you" (ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like, "Fuck you and fuck her, too"
Said, "If I was richer, I'd still be with ya"
Ha, now ain't that some shit?
(Ain't that some shit?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a "Fuck you" (ooh, ooh, ooh)

Now baby, baby, baby, why d'you wanna, wanna hurt me so bad?
(So bad, so bad, so bad)
I tried to tell my mama but she told me
"This is one for your dad"
(Your dad, your dad, your dad)
Yes, she did
And I was like, uh
Why? (Uh) Why? (Uh) Why, lady?
Oh, I love you
Oh, I still love you, oh

I see you driving 'round town with the girl I love
"Fuck you" (ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like, "Fuck you and fuck her, too"
Said, "If I was richer, I'd still be with ya"
Ha, now ain't that some shit?
(Ain't that some shit?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a "Fuck you" (ooh, ooh, ooh)
