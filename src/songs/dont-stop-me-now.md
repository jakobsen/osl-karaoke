Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive
And the world I'll turn it inside out, yeah
I'm floating around in ecstasy
So, (don't stop me now)
(Don't stop me)
'Cause I'm having a good time, having a good time

I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky like a tiger
Defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go, there's no stopping me
I'm burnin' through the sky, yeah
200 degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you

(Don't stop me now)
I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
(Don't stop me now)
If you wanna have a good time
Just give me a call
(Don't stop me now)
'Cause I'm having a good time
(Don't stop me now)
Yes, I'm havin' a good time
I don't want to stop at all, yeah

I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars on a collision course
I am a satellite I'm out of control
I am a sex machine ready to reload like an atom bomb
About to oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode
I'm burnin' through the sky, yeah
200 degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you

Don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me (Hey, hey, hey)
Don't stop me, don't stop me, ooh, ooh, ooh (I like it)
(Don't stop me, don't stop me) Have a good time, good time
(Don't stop me, don't stop me) Woah

Oh, I'm burnin' through the sky, yeah
200 degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit (hey)
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you (hey, hey)
(don't stop me now)
I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
(Don't stop me now)
If you wanna have a good time (ooh, alright)
Just give me a call
(Don't stop me now)
'Cause I'm having a good time (hey, hey)
(Don't stop me now)
Yes, I'm havin' a good time
I don't want to stop at all

Ah, da, da, da, da
Da, da, ah, ah
Ah, da, da, ah, ah, ah
Ah, da, da
Ah, da, da, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
