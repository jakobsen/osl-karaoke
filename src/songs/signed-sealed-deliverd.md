Like a fool I went and stayed too long
Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong
Oo, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!

Then that time I went and said goodbye
Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry
Oo, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!

Here I am baby
Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm yours
Here I am baby
Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm yours

I've done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean, didn't I?

Seen a lot of things in this old world (ooooo)
When I touch them, they mean nothing, girl
Oo, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!

Oo you did, you set my soul on fire (ooo)
That's why I know you're my heart's only desire
Oo, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!

Here I am baby
Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm yours
Here I am baby
Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm yours

I've done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean, didn't I?

_(a capella)_
Here I am baby
Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm yours
Here I am baby
Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm yours

Here I am baby
Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm yours
Here I am baby
Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm yours

Here I am baby
Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm yours
Here I am baby
Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm yours

i’ve done a lot of foolish things, that I really didn’t mean, aaah
